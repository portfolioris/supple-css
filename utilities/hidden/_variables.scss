/**
 * Define which namespaced breakpoints you would like to generate for `hidden`.
 * This is handy if you only need `hidden` on, say, desk, or you only need it
 * at mobile sizes. It allows you to only compile as much CSS as you need.
 * All are empty by default, but you can add breakpoints at will.
 *
 * $in-breakpoint: (lap, desk);
 *
 * Or
 *
 * $in-breakpoint: (
 *   from: lap,
 *   until: lap desk,
 * );
 *
 * Note: the name of the breakpoint must exist in the list of `$mq-breakpoints`
 *       in `settings/responsive`
