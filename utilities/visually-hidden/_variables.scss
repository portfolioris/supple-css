/**
 * Define which namespaced breakpoints you would like to generate for
 * `visually-hidden`. This is handy if you only need `visually-hidden` on, say,
 * desk, or you only need it at mobile sizes. It allows you to only compile
 * as much CSS as you need.
 * All are empty by default, but you can add breakpoints at will.
 *
 * $in-breakpoint: (lap, desk);
 *
 * Or
 *
 * $in-breakpoint: (
 *   from: lap,
 *   until: lap desk,
 * );
 *
 * Note: the name of the breakpoint must exist in the list of `$breakpoints`
 *       in `settings/defaults`
