Supple CSS is a reliable and testable [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) framework in its truest sense. It's based on the [ITCSS](https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528) methodology and is suited very well for **component-based UI development**. Supple CSS plays well with React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, and every other component-based approach to UI development.
