A reset of sensible defaults, roughly based on Andy Bell's excellent [A Modern CSS Reset](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/). Combined with Supple's vertical rhythm it provides a powerful reset for web applications.

## Use

Import this reset before any other stylesheets that generate CSS like this:

```scss
@use '@supple-kit/supple-css/generic/reset';
```
